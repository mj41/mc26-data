# mc26-data

Minecraft: Java Edition game data as JSON, extracted from Mojang's unobfuscated server jars by
[mc26](https://github.com/mj41/mc26): registries, packet ids and the typed wire schema of every
packet, data components and their schema, the NBT schema of the registries a server sends its
clients, items, blocks and block states, entities, block entities, biomes and the language
files, with `_meta.json` (Minecraft version, data version, protocol, jar checksum, extractor
commit). Each branch also carries `docs/`, the same as Markdown for a reader: the frame, the
primitives and node kinds, every packet, every component, every registry element.

- One branch per Minecraft release: `mc-26.1`, `mc-26.2`, … `main` holds only this README.
- Tags `v0.<YYN>.<n>` pin an extraction (`v0.262.0` is Minecraft 26.2; `n` counts re-extractions
  with a newer extractor).
- JSON and its documentation, no code: fetch by tag, raw URL or submodule from any language.
- Snapshots and pre-releases live in [mc26-data-pre](https://github.com/mj41/mc26-data-pre).
